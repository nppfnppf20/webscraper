Under the terms of the Board's Byelaws, the prior written consent of the Board is required for any proposed temporary or permanent works or structures in, under, over or within the byelaw 9m distance of the top of the bank of a Board maintained watercourse. The full 9m is required to be kept clear of all obstructions to allow maintenance with heavy plant. It is not clear from the submitted drawings if this distance (from the top of the bank) has been left.

Under the terms of the Land Drainage Act. 1991 the prior written consent of the Board is required for any proposed temporary or permanent works or structures within any watercourse including infilling or a diversion. This includes any works within watercourses for the proposed cable route.

A permanent undeveloped strip of sufficient width should be made available adjacent to the top of the bank of all watercourses on Site to allow future maintenance works to be undertaken. Suitable access arrangements to this strip should also be agreed. As noted in 3.41 and 3.42 in the FRA.

I am seeking comments/assurances concerning this.
