3893,149857,2025-08-28T10:20:59,2025-08-29T12:00:39,Request,1,"In regard to all BNG and ecological matters in regard to this application I have the following comments.

BNG Baseline
I do not have any substantive concerns over the baseline details provided, these site is not within the Biodiversity Opportunity Mapping and their is no historic signs of degradation that must be accounted for 

The only concern I have is that I cannot locate the River Condition assessment for the other river stream. it appears they have used the ditch condition assessment this is not appropriate a MORPH RCA is required

BNG Post development 
This is difficult to assess as a post development habitat map has not been provided, there is a landscaping plan but this does not translate directly to the metric, I would appreciate an actual habitat map to aid in this assessment 

As with all solar projects I am concerned regarding target habitat type and condition under panels. When reviewing BNG proposal we must be satisfied the outcomes are achievable by the end of the 30 year period, research by Solar Energy UK shows high discrepancy in delivery under panels, the LPAs preferred approach to minimise future enforcement risk is to target only poor condition modified grassland under panels. At present the applicant tis proposing other neutral grassland but this comes with a requirements for at least 8 species per square meter (the applicant has also indicates some will be in moderate condition which is a further concern) . The proposed grassland mixes are also of a tussocky variety rather than prioritising shade tolerance further raising my concern. There has also been a lack of consideration to soil sampling which will be required to inform grassland management on previous agricultural land as weed management and grass dominance will be potential problems over the lifetime of the scheme. In addition grazing has been mentioned but not planned for in the HMMP, I appreciate that grazing may not be viable every year or throughout the full lifetime of the project but details of how grazing should be used when amiable is required. 

The applicant plans to retain arable field margins, unfortunately as BNG uses the UKHab Definition, these cannot be classed as arable field margins post developments as they will no longer surround an arable field. they must be recorded as lost and recreated as the relevant grassland type. This will negatively impact the trading rules. It is advisable the the applicant consider creating high distinctiveness habitat to compensate, this could be in the form of reed bed creation near exiting water features or potential consideration of orchard planting

There will be the requirement for a s106 and monitoring fee, our local monitoring fees do no currently extend to sites of this scale, I will propose a fee that takes influence from DEFRA approved landscape recover schemes. The fee will include time taken on each monitoring year (monitoring frequency will be 1,3,5,10,15,20,25,30) to review and respond to documents submitted by the applicant and time for Quality assurance site visits (likely on years 2, 5, 15, 25, 30) that are supported by AI generated habitat mapping to inform a 20% sampling selection for all non beneath panel habitat and a 20% selection of panels for check beneath.  

Habitat Management and Monitoring Plan
The applicant has provided this upfront which is a benefit.

I would ask for further clarity and additional details added that satisfies the below

Initial creation
Explanation as to how climate change models (RCP 8.5) have impacted management, species selection and/or provenance of woody plant species. (climatematch.org should be used to source nurseries)
Explanation as to how soil sampling has impacted creation/enhancement of grassland habitats or any habitat creation on previous arable/contaminated land. This should include nutrient stripping steps
Explanation as to how grassland creation has prioritised local seed banks through means of green hay spreading (local source Pickering Meadow)
Explanation habitat creation/enhancement has included micro-topologies to maximise ecological niches (bunds, mounds, scrapes etc.).
Explanation as to how riparian management has taken into account 3D buffer strip models

Ongoing Management
Explanation as to which conservation grazing methods have been adopted (seasonal, rotational, low grazing density, High intensity short period mob grazing, species/breed selection etc) and where grazing cannot be used how will natural process be replicated.
Explanation as to how management allows for creation/maintenance of quality overwintering habitat.
Inclusion of management requirements for retained habitats 

Monitoring 
Increased monitoring frequency to match LPA requirements
Commitment to provide monitoring report no later than September 1st on each monitoring year 
Commitment to fix point photography to show progress 
Commitment to share data with the Local Environmental Records Centre

Wider Ecological Matters

Generally there are no concerns regarding protected species, although enhancements will be required to be secured via condition, such requirements will include non habitat enhancements in the style artificial roost features, 2 way badger gates and hedgehog holes in security fencing, insect hotel style features, hibernacula and refugia. 

My only  outstanding concern is the cumulative impact of these type of developments on Ground nesting birds. Although the conversion to permeant grassland will benefit foraging behaviour of these species, the inclusion of panels presents a potential increased predation risk and reduced opportunity for nesting. I need to understand the impact on nesting pairs and how new nesting opportunities will be created (both on and potentially offsite) ",Principal Ecology and Wildlife Officer,chris.harrison@central-lincs.org.uk,

We agree that Green Renewable Energy is the way forward and in favour of solar farms/off shore wind farms but they need to be in the right places - on roofs tops, car parks, industrial buildings not on good argricultural land. There would be loss of land for farming that produces food, which would them lead to an increase in the cost of food having to be brought in/imported - which wouldn't be good for the environment.
The site is situated between Scothern and Dunholme, and will require about 4 miles of underground cabling along Heath Rd, along the A46 to South of Nettleham. This seems like there would be a lot of disruption and a negative impact on the environment, traffic & wildlife to get to the grid connection south of Nettleham. The PC would like to suggest alternative sites are sought, closer to the grid connection, sub station that would be far more suitable, less distruption and less harm to the environment.
Flood Risk - Scothern has suffered in the last 2 years from flooding in the centre of the village with surface water running off the land, into the village. The beck along Main Street and the Northing Lane pumping station can't cope with the current level of water. How would the surface water be prevented from running off the land towards the village of Scothern?
Will the Public Rights of Way be protected? There are two, very much used public footpaths, currently across the countryside fields, that run straight through the planned sites.
Will the current hedgerows and trees be protected?
Impact on the Landscape Character - Scothern is a rural village, surrounded by farmland. After the forty 'tempoary' years, who will remove all the concrete structures from the site back to the farmland? And, what impact will these concrete structures have on the land after forty years?
Access to the site - the Parish Council would like to ensure the route to the development is from the A46 as stated and not through the village either from the A158 or Nettleham Rd (Scothern to Nettleham). This is for the safety of pupils from Elison Boulters School on Sudbrooke Road and the narrow road and sharp corners on Nettleham Road, which would be a dangerous situation for residents.
The developers have assured the Parish Council that the sub-station will only serve the Barlings Solar Farm as there is no capacity for another site to use it, can WLDC also assure this is correct information?
The developers have indicated that there will be approximately £20,000 community benefit fund. Scothern Parish Council would like to lead the group managing this funding if the development is successful and approved and would like confirmation in any agreement.
